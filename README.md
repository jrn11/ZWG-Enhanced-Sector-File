## First-time Installation Instructions
1. [Download latest release](https://github.com/kolbyd/ZWG-Enhanced-Sector-File/releases) (any file starting with `CZWG_Full`, .zip file is more common).
2. Unzip the downloaded file. You can store the unzipped folder anywhere on your computer.
3. Open the folder and open `CZWG.prf` with Euroscope.
*Make sure you use `Open with` function on Windows if your computer doesn't launch the file in Euroscope automatically. Do not use the open button in Euroscope to open a .prf file!*
4. Once `CZWG.prf` has opened in Euroscope, you can click `Open SCT` then `Load sector file` to load the .sct file included with the package.

## Auto-installation
The sector file is designed with automatic installation in mind using Euroscope's built-in functionality.

Click `Open SCT` then `Download Sector Files...`, you should see the following when you first install the files.

This means that the provider is working properly. You might get asked to load a new sector file when it auto-downloads.

If it isn't working as expected, you can add the provider manually. Ensure you set the URL as `http://files.winnipegfir.ca/` (trailing slash is important). Checking the `A` box on the provider and the provided file is important for getting the files to update automatically.

Previous releases of the sector file will be provided in case of any issues (can be downloaded from the same menu.)
